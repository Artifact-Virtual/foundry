# Foundry Courier â€“ End-to-End Test Report

**Date:** August 13, 2025

## Test Summary

All core system functions were tested using the automated end-to-end test suite. The following tests were performed:

- Encode a signed transaction hex into frames using the CLI
- Decode frames back into the original transaction hex using the CLI
- CLI help and service listing

## Results

- [PASS] Encode/decode cycle: The system successfully encoded and decoded a sample transaction, with the output matching the original input.
- [PASS] CLI help: The CLI help command displayed available services and usage information.

**All end-to-end tests passed. The system is operational and ready for field use.**

## Recommendations

- Continue to add more tests for edge cases, error handling, and integration with push_btc/push_eth when live nodes are available.
- Review and test gateway and SMS modules in real-world scenarios.
